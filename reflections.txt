# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?

I used multiple gems. First i used the formatador gem to have a more polished list output (although it gets a bit overloaded for many entries) then i used the artii gem to make some nice headers for the list. The last gem i used was the catpix gem, which  puts images into my newly created image class.  

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1 are multiple entries for filtering. It is now possible to filter different items. For example „event“ and „todo“ at the same time 
  b) Feature 2 is the additional class ImageItem. It is now possible to add images and descriptions of the image into the list. 

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?

I spend around 6 hours on this project. 

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

The most rewarding challenges were the additional features. At first it took me a while to manage the filter method, because i didn’t thought about the .class method for all items to filter. This took me a while to figure out, but in the end i am pretty proud that this works now efficient without redundant code. Furthermore the catpix gem was pretty useful and easy to use with stunning results.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?

the image Class and the possibility for multiple entries in the filter list
(see above)

4. Where do you still have room to grow?

I think i have to learn more about accessing classes from another class and more syntax sugar, to let the code look more decent. Overall i am really proud on finishing this project and entering into the world of gems, because that makes a lot of things much easier and therefore less impossible :-)
